FLG's fork of OPC
=================

This is the Flaming Lotus Girls fork of Open Pixel Control, which has been
modified for use with our art piece, [Soma][soma], currently on permanent
installation along the [San Francisco waterfront][pier14].  If you're
interested in OPC in general and not specifically for use with Soma, you
probably want the usptram version, at
[https://github.com/zestyping/openpixelcontrol][opc].  For more information
about using OPC to develop patterns for Soma, please see
[https://github.com/FlamingLotusGirls/soma/tree/master/pier14/opc-client][opc-client].
